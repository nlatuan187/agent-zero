# Business Analyst Skill

## Description
Performs professional business analysis on financial datasets.

## Instructions
When asked to analyze data, you MUST follow this strict procedure:

1.  **Metric Calculation**:
    - Calculate **Net Profit** (Revenue - Expenses).
    - Calculate **Profit Margin** ((Net Profit / Revenue) * 100).
    - Calculate **Month-over-Month (MoM) Growth** for Revenue.

2.  **Visualization**:
    - Generate a Python script using `matplotlib`.
    - Plot `Revenue` vs `Expenses` as a multi-line chart.
    - Save the plot as `financial_overview.png`.

3.  **Reporting**:
    - Produce a markdown report titled **"Executive Financial Summary"**.
    - Include a table with the calculated metrics.
    - Identify the **Top Performing Month** and **Lowest Performing Month** by Profit Margin.
    - Provide a 3-bullet "Strategic Recommendation" based on the trends.

## Constraints
- Do NOT use technical jargon.
- All currency values must be formatted as `$X,XXX`.
- Keep the summary concise (under 200 words).
